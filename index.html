                        My name is Chirag Goyal and my journey in this university started 3 years ago. I came here in 2k18 batch in Electrical Engineering, which for me was a big challenge because I wanted to pursue Computer Science in some other university. After 3 years, I can say that the decision that I made to come to this university is one of the best that I have made so far in my life.
<br><br>
This year I’ve been elected as the new president of the Student Council. For me, it is a great honor to be part of this university,  and I will try my best to successfully complete this year as your president. I plan to do whatever it takes to help care for all the students and important university issues.
<br><br>
I wanted to be this year’s Student Council president because I think that during these hard moments of living in a pandemic, there has to be a person who is going to manage these difficult situations. With the help of all the students and teachers in the school, this year we have to be more united than ever and think as one. I will show consistently that I’m prepared to take on this challenge and prove that I can be a great role model. I want to help others see that in this school we are more than a group of students; we are a family.  We will all succeed and achieve our goals together.
                        <br><br>
                        See you soon,
                        <br><br> <b>Chirag Goyal</b><br>Student Council President<br>(2021-22)
